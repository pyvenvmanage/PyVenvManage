<b>PyVenvManage 2</b> is a plugin for managing the Python interpreter of Python projects.

It is a general issue that Python projects may have several interpreters in different
virtual environments for the various versions of the language. Managing these venvs
is easily done with `tox`, but configuring the interpreter for the project or module is painful.

With PyVenvManage 2 the selection and setup of the venv is a few clicks without unwanted dialog boxes.
